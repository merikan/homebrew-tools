# How to update a Formula

> This is a note to myself how to update a 3d party formula. In the following case it is a small gem called gitleaks I am updating from version 1.22 to 1.23.
1. Update homebrew
   ```bash
   $ brew update && brew upgrade
   ```
1. Cd into the tap
   ```bash
   $ cd  $(brew --repo merikan/tools)
   ```
1. Checkout a new branch (gitleaks) to work on
    ```bash
    $ git checkout -b gitleaks
    ```
1. Lint current version before editing
   ```bash
   $ brew audit --strict --online gitleaks
   ```
1. Edit the formula
   Update the url and version. We will let homebrew help us with the checksum.
   ```bash
   $ brew edit gitleaks
   ````
1. Calculate the checksum
   ```bash
   $ brew fetch gitleaks

   SHA256: 82397216bd9a362d134a5e190764e5a5233f9feb850c04f5fc60dd682595dbc1

   ```
   As you can see, home-brew complains about the checksum. Copy the checksum to the formula and save.
   Run fetch again to make sure it's ok
   ```bash
   $ brew fetch gitleaks

   ==> Caveats
   This is not the official Formula from the creator of `gitleaks`. It is only for my personal
   use until Zachary provides a official Formula.
   In the meantime jump over to github and star the repository.
