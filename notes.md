# How to update a Formula

> This is a note to myself how to update a 3d party formula. In the following case it is a small gem called gitleaks I am updating from version 1.22 to 1.23.
1. Update homebrew
   ```bash
   $ brew update && brew upgrade
   ```
1. Cd into the tap
   ```bash
   $ cd  $(brew --repo merikan/tools)
   ```
1. Checkout a new branch (gitleaks) to work on
    ```bash
    $ git checkout -b gitleaks
    ```
1. Lint current version before editing
   ```bash
   $ brew audit --strict --online gitleaks
   ```
1. Edit the formula   
   Update the url and version. We will let homebrew help us calculate the checksum.
   ```bash
   $ brew edit gitleaks
   ````
1. Calculate the checksum
   ```bash
   $ brew fetch gitleaks

   ```
   As you can see, home-brew complains about the checksum. Copy the checksum to the formula and save.
   Run fetch again to make sure it's ok
   ```bash
   $ brew fetch gitleaks

   ==> Caveats
   This is not the official Formula from the creator of `gitleaks`. It is only for my personal
   use until Zachary provides a official Formula.
   In the meantime jump over to github and star the repository.

# How to migrate a formula

`gitleaks` was not in the `homebrew/core` tap so I brewed it in this tap. Now gitleaks is available in the core tap and the following example is how to move it from this tap to `homebrew/core` tap

1. Cd into the tap
   ```bash
   $ cd  $(brew --repo merikan/tools)
   ```
1. Create a file called `tap_migrations.json` in the root of the repository.
1. Add the formula name and the name of the new tap
    ```
    {
      "gitleaks": "homebrew/core"
    }
    ```
1. Delete the formula and any text referencing this formula
1. Commit and push
    ```
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "gitleaks: migrate to homebrew/core"
    ¬ß git push
    ```
1. And update/upgrade
    ```
    $ brew update && brew upgrade
    Already up-to-date.

# How to rename a formula
1. Cd into the tap
   ```bash
   $ cd  $(brew --repo merikan/tools)
   ```
1. Rename the formula and any text referencing the formula
1. Create a file called `formula_renames.json` in the root of this repository.
1. Add the old and new name of the formula
    ```
    {
      "oldformula": "newformula"
    }
    ```
1. Commit and push
    ```
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "oldformula: renamed to newformula"
    ¬ß git push
