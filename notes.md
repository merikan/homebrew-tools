# How to create a Formula
> This is a note to myself how to create a 3d party formula. In the following case it is a small gem called kind. 
1. Update homebrew
   ```bash
   $ brew update && brew upgrade
   ```
1. Cd into the tap
   ```bash
   $ cd  $(brew --repo merikan/tools)
   ```
1. Checkout a new branch (kind) to work in
    ```bash
    $ git checkout -b kind
    ```
1. Create the formula
    We will use the `brew create` command with a URL to the binary and using the opetion `--tap`.
    ```bash
    $ brew create https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases/download/v0.4.0/kind-darwin-amd64 ‚Äî-tap merikan/homebrew-tools

    Please `brew audit --new-formula kind` before submitting, thanks.
    Editing /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/merikan/homebrew-tools/Formula/kind.rb
    ```
    Homebrew will download the binary and try to populate `desc`, `homepage`, `url`, `version` and `sha256` and then open the Formula in your default editor. Make sure it‚Äôs created in the right directory, in my case it is  `/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/merikan/homebrew-tools/Formula`
    Now edit the the formula and save it.
1.  This is the formula after editing
    ```bash
    class Kind < Formula
      desc "Kubernetes IN Docker - local clusters for testing Kubernetes"
      homepage "https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/"
      url "https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases/download/v0.4.0/kind-darwin-amd64"
      version "0.4.0"
      sha256 "023f1886207132dcfc62139a86f09488a79210732b00c9ec6431d6f6b7e9d2d3"

      def install
        bin.install "kind-darwin-amd64" => "kind"
      end

      def caveats; <<~EOS
        This is not the official Formula from the creator of `kind`. It is only for my personal
        use until the Kubernetes team provides a official Formula.
        In the meantime jump over to github and star the repository.

        Kudos to Kubernetes Team for creating kind. https://kubernetes.io/
      EOS
      end

      test do
        system "#{bin}/kind", "-h"
      end
    end
    ```
1.  lint the formula and fix any error
    ```bash
    $ brew audit --strict --online kind
    ```
1.  Install the formula
    ```bash
    $ brew install kind

# How to update a Formula

> This is a note to myself how to update a 3d party formula. In the following case it is a small gem called gitleaks I am updating from version 1.22 to 1.23.
1. Update homebrew
   ```bash
   $ brew update && brew upgrade
   ```
1. Cd into the tap
   ```bash
   $ cd  $(brew --repo merikan/tools)
   ```
1. Checkout a new branch (gitleaks) to work in
    ```bash
    $ git checkout -b gitleaks
    ```
1. Lint current version before editing
   ```bash
   $ brew audit --strict --online gitleaks
   ```
1. Edit the formula   
   Update the url and version. We will let homebrew help us calculate the checksum.
   ```bash
   $ brew edit gitleaks
   ````
1. Calculate the checksum
   ```bash
   $ brew fetch gitleaks

   As you can see, home-brew complains about the checksum. Copy the checksum to the formula and save.

# How to migrate a formula

`gitleaks` was not in the `homebrew/core` tap so I brewed it in this tap. Now gitleaks is available in the core tap and the following example is how to move it from this tap to `homebrew/core` tap

1. Cd into the tap
   ```bash
   $ cd  $(brew --repo merikan/tools)
   ```
1. Create a file called `tap_migrations.json` in the root of the repository.
1. Add the formula name and the name of the new tap
    ```
    {
      "gitleaks": "homebrew/core"
    }
    ```
1. Delete the formula and any text referencing this formula
1. Commit and push
    ```
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "gitleaks: migrate to homebrew/core"
    ¬ß git push
    ```
1. And update/upgrade
    ```
    $ brew update && brew upgrade
    Already up-to-date.

# How to rename a formula
1. Cd into the tap
   ```bash
   $ cd  $(brew --repo merikan/tools)
   ```
1. Rename the formula and any text referencing the formula
1. Create a file called `formula_renames.json` in the root of this repository.
1. Add the old and new name of the formula
    ```
    {
      "oldformula": "newformula"
    }
    ```
1. Commit and push
    ```
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "oldformula: renamed to newformula"
    ¬ß git push
    ```
