# homebrew-tools

This is my homebrew tap where I'm brewing some nice tools for easy installation with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

Gitleaks provides a way for you to find unencrypted secrets and other unwanted data types in git source code repositories.

This is **not the official Formula** from the creator of gitleaks. It is only for my personal use until Zachary provides a official Formula.
